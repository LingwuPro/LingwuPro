# MCM-2023 Question C problem solving code

For the data set obtained from the wordle game, we use the characteristics of words to predict the distribution of the percentage of players' attempts through integrated learning, and at the same time evaluate the properties of words, and give the word difficulty according to the properties. The following is our code to solve the problem:

- model&statistic.py: We use this part of code to clean, integrate and abstract data, and get a series of tables; At the same time, this part of the code is used to perform the operation of machine learning, evaluate and predict the relevant content.
- pic.py: We used this part of code to complete the drawing of some images. At the same time, we also used Visio, tableau, excel and other non-programming software to assist us in drawing.
- wegt.py: This code is used to crawl related data sets.
